CodeNewbie challenge, [Just One More](http://www.codenewbie.org/blogs/just-one-more)

### _Code version_
- Python 3.5.1

Run `python -m unittest discover` in the root directory of the repository to
run the tests.

## _Progress_

This is my first attempt of Test Driven Development. The requirements are linked
above, in the CodeNewbie challenge.

- Make the test - _Check_
- Make the code able to pass the test - _Check_
    - Level 1 - _Pass_
    - Level 2 - _Pass_
    - Level 3 - _Pass_
- Refactoring - _Check_

## _Experience gained_

Interesting and challenging to make the code like this. Also gave myself the
added challenge of having all the tests be successfull from the same function.
 I found it to be harder to make the code like this, but I think when it comes
to refactoring it will be very usefull to have the tests.

Next time I might just make it less complex from the start, breaking it down
 into smaller parts/functions. Will see when I have done the refactoring.

#### _Refactoring_

Having a code that passed the tests was very useful for refactoring. Made me
able to see what was needed for the code to work. I think the code got easier
to read after the refactoring was done.

Having tests I could see quickly what works and what doesn't work when
 refactoring. Also learned a lot about unit testing in general during this
 challenge.
